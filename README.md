# Excel-VBA-Add-Duplicate-Rows-
VBA Add duplicate rows in an excel sheet based on a value in a column.

Add row line to seperate the different areas also.

Took most ideas from https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/4054-excel-duplicate-rows-based-on-cell-value.html

Tweaked it to add the line between sections
